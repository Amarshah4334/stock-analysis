Tools to Work With VBA

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We ran this porject code for Steve so that at the click of a button, he can analyze the entire stock market over the last few years for his parents. to get him this data i will edit, or refactor, the solution code to loop through all the data one time to determine if doing that made the VBA script run faster. The idea is to make it easier for Steve and more effecient for his time. 



Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.




Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring includes small changes to code to eliminate clutter or messy code , it can also be a process of eliminating hard coded values making the outlook broader and leaves it application in a simplified working state.

Advantages:
The advantages of the refactored code is simplicity of use and ease of modification by any other user. the logic is displayed comprehensivily as loops and conditionals. 
When the code is written in VBA these conditionals and loops are seen that were otherwise not visualised in the original source code.

Disadvantages:

Long codes may have errors that need debugging and take time in getting right. Understanding of the end result is critical in code application otherwise it results in several repetitive lines of code which appear ad duplicates. 
Also if the code is complex it will need to be split and information must be written intermittently to indicate what the code that was written was for, otherwise when reviewing the code it will literally be impossible to clearly understand the code or modify it .





How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Refactoring can be achieved by updating the code without changing the softwareâ€™s function. When the code was written if it becomes challenging to modify the code on a later time, then the instructions included or simplicity of code writing was done without paying attention to detal and the necessary improvements were not achieved successfully.

It is important that when we refactor the original code it is done such that complicated functionality were eliminated. this is easy to read in future and can be updated with simplicity by anyone looking at it.
